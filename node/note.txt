Using https://github.com/prologic/bitcask instead of in memory kv store
Supports fast access to upto 1M KV Pairs using disk as backing store
If we want billions of records then should use LevelDB as mentioned here
https://github.com/prologic/bitcask#is-bitcask-right-for-my-project
Since we are already sharding choosen bitcask
